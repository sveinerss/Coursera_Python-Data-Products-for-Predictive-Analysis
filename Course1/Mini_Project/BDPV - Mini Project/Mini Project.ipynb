    "An abalone is a sea snail belonging to one of a range of 30 to 130 species (depending on which scientist you ask). It is commonly prized for its mother-of-pearl shell, pearls, and delicious flesh by a variety of cultures and has long been a valuable source of food in its native environments. Sadly, wild populations of abalone have been overfished and poached to the point where commercial farming supplies most of abalone flesh nowadays. It now sits on the list of current animals threatened by extinction.\n",
